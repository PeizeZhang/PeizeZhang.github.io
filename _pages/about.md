This is Peize Zhang's personal homepage. Please also refer to my [homepage@UoO](https://www.oulu.fi/en/researchers/peize-zhang). 

## A short introduction
Peize Zhang received the B.S. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2015, the M.S. degree from the China Academy of Telecommunications Technology, Beijing, China, in 2018, and the Ph.D. degree (Hons.) from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2022, all in electrical engineering.

From 2016 to 2018, he was also a research assistant with the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, Beijing, China. In 2021, he was a visiting Ph.D. student with the Université catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. Since 2022, he has been a postdoctoral researcher in 6G Flagship programme with the Centre for Wireless Communications (CWC), University of Oulu, Finland. His current research interests focus on propagation, deployment, and performance issues of millimeter-wave/THz communication systems.

<b>Research Highlights:</b>
* Development of [spectral transformation](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026962) and its [application](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126816) in hydro-climatology
* An [open-source tool](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WASP/index.html) for improved system modelling: [Wavelet System Prediction (WASP)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104907)
* Development of a [postprocessing method](https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-22-0217.1) and [software](https://zejiang-unsw.github.io/software/WQM/) for correcting bias in Numerical Weather Predictions in the time-frequency domain
* Quantification of future changes in [drought](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022EF003350) and [agricultural production](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-018-2617-z) under global warming
* Development of [index-based drought insurance](https://doi.org/10.1108/AFR-02-2020-0020) for disaster risk transfer
